Simulating Ball Movement

## Moving Ball Simulation
Simulation link: [3 bouncing balls] (https://marialee222.github.io/moveBall3.github.io/moveBall3.html/)
Simple three bouncing balls were created by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

No installation or setup instructions.

This project can be used to 1) decide the area where the bouncing balls will perform bouncing, 2) design the bouncing balls and add some bouncing functionality to them. 

You can comment to leave general comments or questions.  You can suggest changes that I can apply directly from your comment.

Future iterations will include features to make it interactive. 

This is a work in progress.  Please feel free to expand and build upon the source code.  Feedback is welcome.
